        surely agree with me, let’s discover them together.

    <div id="Niagara falls">

    <p>
        The historical roots of Niagara Falls lie in the glaciation
        of Wisconsin finished about 10,000 years ago. The Great Lakes of America
        of the north and the Niagara River are the effect of the dissolution of this 
        huge mass of ice. The glacier has moved in this area as 
        a giant bulldozer moving rocks and earth and transforming the 
        rivers in lakes, creating barriers with its debris, which in turn 
        They created new canals that then became rivers.

    <p>
        Before the use of bricks, the Great Wall had been built primarily 
        using rammed earth, stones and wood. During the Ming Dynasty, however, 
        bricks were used in many areas of the wall, as were materials such as 
        tile, lime, and stone. The size and weight of the bricks made them 
        easier to work with than earth and stone, speeding up construction. 
        In addition, bricks could withstand more weight and last longer than 
        clay.

        It is found off the coast of Queensland in northeastern Australia.
        The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from space and is the most
        large structure made of living organisms. The structure consists of
        billions of tiny organisms, known as coral polyps.
        The reef has a great biodiversity, and has been included as a Heritage
        of Humanity in 1981. CNN included it in its Seven Wonders of the World.
