    <h1>All fruit</h1>

    <p>
        In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants
        that is formed from the ovary after flowering.
        Fruits are the means by which flowering plants 
        disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular have 
        long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a 
        symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for 
        the one group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many 
        animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.
